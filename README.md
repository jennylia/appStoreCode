# appStoreCode
I grabbed this app from code academy because the css looked really nice. This code would work with the yelp server I uploaded a few days ago. It contains the http service.

The yelp server:
origin	git@github.com:jennylia/yelp_express.git (push)

An extension for CORS header whitelisting - localhost:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en

If your server didnt' take care of ya
